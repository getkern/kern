# Changelog

This project is pre-release and a work in progress: there are no versioned releases, and the CLI and
config surface may change at any time. Build from source with
`cargo install --git https://github.com/getkern/kern getkern --locked`. What follows is the current
state of the tree; full detail is in the git history.

## Unreleased

### Security

- Registry-posture forgery closed: `-v` refuses any source resolving onto the trust-bearing registry
  dirs, by `(device, inode)` identity as well as path.
- `socket(AF_VSOCK, …)` refused with `EAFNOSUPPORT` in both seccomp modes.
- The bounding-set drop is verified with `PR_CAPBSET_READ`, failing closed if any cap survives.
- `CAP_SYS_PTRACE` dropped by default (14 caps), closing the `/proc/<pid>/mem` cross-process read.
- The seccomp mode is recorded and reproduced by `kern exec` and the health probe, not re-derived
  from the caller's env; an absent or corrupt record makes `exec` fail-loud.
- `KERN_MAX_CONCURRENT` enforced atomically under a `flock`, closing the fleet-cap TOCTOU.
- A SIGKILL'd detached supervisor's box is reaped via `cgroup.kill`.
- An inherited caller fd no longer leaks into the box: `shed_inherited_fds` before `execvp`
  (CVE-2016-9962 class).
- A pulled layer's setuid/setgid bit is stripped at extraction.

### Fixed

- A detached box's captured log is size-capped (two-file 32 MiB ring, zero-copy `splice`), so a
  runaway writer can't fill the session tmpfs.
- An OOM kills the whole box (`memory.oom.group = 1`), not one process.
- `kern ps`/`gc` under fd exhaustion no longer prunes or mis-reaps a live box (three-state liveness).
- A SIGKILL'd/OOM'd detached supervisor no longer leaves an unreachable "ghost": liveness reads
  `cgroup.events` `populated`; an orphan is visible (`--filter status=orphaned`) and reaped
  identity-safe against pid reuse.
- systemd detection mirrors libsystemd's own bus resolution, so kern attempts `systemd-run --user`
  only where it works (a dir-only host no longer fails every box).
- A non-UTF-8 argument fails validation instead of panicking.
- The instance record is written atomically (temp + `rename`).
- `kern doctor` write-probes the real cap target; an unenforceable cap warns instead of running
  silently uncapped; `--pids-limit 1` is refused at parse; a second `vcpu:` profile warns.
- `volume ls --json` no longer lists names not on disk or misdirects a delete (display vs exact
  syscall form, `usable` flag); `kern <verb> --help` filters to the verb on a real terminal.

### Added

- A CI gate fails, naming the syscall, when a new kernel `__NR_*` is neither allowed, denied, nor on
  the reviewed list (x86_64 + aarch64).
